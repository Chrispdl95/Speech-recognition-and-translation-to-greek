## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- SpeechRecognition library (`pip install SpeechRecognition`)
- Translate library (`pip install translate`)
- pyttsx3 library (optional, for text-to-speech functionality) (`pip install pyttsx3`)

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Speak into the microphone.
3. The recognized text and its Greek translation will be displayed in the console.
4. [Optional] Uncomment the lines for text-to-speech functionality if desired.

## Configuration
